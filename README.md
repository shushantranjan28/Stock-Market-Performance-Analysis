## Stock Market Data Analysis using Python

This project showcases an analysis of stock market data for four major companies: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG). The data was obtained using the `yfinance` library and analyzed using Python and Pandas.

### Project Overview

1. Data Collection: The stock market data for the last 3 months was collected using the `yfinance` library. The data includes opening, closing, high, and low prices, as well as volume and adjusted closing prices for each company.

2. Data Analysis and Visualization: The collected data was analyzed and visualized to gain insights into the performance of the companies. Various plots, including line charts and area charts, were created to visualize the stock prices and moving averages for each company.

3. Correlation Analysis: A correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft. A scatter plot was used to visualize the correlation, and a trendline was calculated to show the relationship between the two.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- yfinance
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Results and Insights

- The line charts illustrate the stock prices of the four companies over the last 3 months, providing insights into their performance and trends.

- Moving averages (MA10 and MA20) were calculated to identify potential trends and support/resistance levels for each company.

- The scatter plot with the trendline indicates a positive correlation between the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft, suggesting that their prices tend to move in the same direction.

### Project Benefits

- Enhanced skills in data collection, manipulation, and analysis using Python and Pandas.

- Developed proficiency in data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

- Gained insights into the stock market performance of major companies and correlation analysis.

### Repository Contents
